I am a computer systems researcher. I earned my bachelor's and master's at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's [Department of Computer Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/). My current interests include serverless computing and in-memory processing (PIM) amongst other architecture, distributed, and operating systems research.

Most recently, I have worked with Jovan Stojkovic and [Professor Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/) in software caches for serverless systems. Prior to that, I explored optimizations to partitioning large DNN models for serverless inference. 

Following graduation from UIUC, I worked at Oracle as a software engineer for almost two years mostly developing disaster recovery features for [OCI](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) content management.


I am from BogotÃ¡, Colombia.
