        <p>I am a computer architecture PhD student at The University of Texas at Austin advised by <a href="https://cascade.cs.utexas.edu/">Jovan Stojkovic</a>.<br>
          I am interested in mitigating the frontend-bound cycles in modern datacenter workloads.
          I aim to address this problem through a hardware–software co-design of microarchitectural and compiler innovations.<br>
          
          I earned my bachelor's and master's at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>.
        </p>
        <p>I am from Bogotá, Colombia.</p>
