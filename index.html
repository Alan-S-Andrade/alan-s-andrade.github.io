        <p>I am a computer systems researcher. I earned my bachelor's and master's at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>.
        My current interests include serverless computing and in-memory processing (PIM) amongst other architecture, distributed, and operating systems research.
        Most recently, I have worked with Jovan Stojkovic and <a href="https://tianyin.github.io/">Professor Tianyin Xu</a> in software caches for serverless systems. Prior to that, I explored optimizations to partitioning large DNN models for serverless inference. 
        Following graduation from UIUC, I worked at Oracle as a software engineer for almost two years mostly developing disaster recovery features for [OCI](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) content management. </p>

      </p>I am from Bogot√°, Colombia.</p>
